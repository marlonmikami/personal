# Quitting Porn


**I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY QUITTING PORN**


The only thing stopping me is fear. It’s fear that keeps people from quitting, fear of that empty, insecure feeling they get when they stop flooding their brains with dopamine.

 Aks yourself:
1. What is porn doing for me?
2. Am I actually enjoying it?
3. Do I really need to go through life sabotaging my mind and body?

Porn does NOTHING for you. You are not giving anything up. Life is not any more enjoyable with porn in it. You are not being deprived of anything, you not missing out on anything.

Porn doesn’t fill a void, it creates one!

---

You do not need to rely on willpower, but instead to deconstruct the imagine value of pornography.

---

Imagine the state of panic of a heroin addict without any heroin; now picture their utter joy when they can finally plunge a needle into their vein. People who aren’t addicted to heroin don’t suffer that panicked feeling.

The heroin doesn’t relieve the feeling, it causes it. Similarly, non-users don’t suffer empty feelings of needing internet porn, or panic when they’re offline.

---

Be constantly aware that porn isn’t habit, it’s drug addiction.

The thrill is in the hunting, not the killing, with dopamine rapidly leaving the body after orgasm.

----

The reason why most continue using is because although we know the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages, we believe there’s something in porn that we actually enjoy or that it acts like some sort of prop. We’re under the illusion that after we stop using there will be a void, certain situations in our lives never being quite the same. In fact porn not only provides nothing, it subtracts.

---

You are not **giving up** porn, you are **escaping** it, becoming free of it.

---

You need to be aware of the brainwashing.
