## Aging

* Use sunscreen

## Weight Loss

* Current Weight: 68kg
* Goal Weight: 60kg
  
Reasons for weight loss: 
* I don't like looking fat
* I don't like feeling fat

### Plan

I'll be eating once one meal a day, prioritizing high volume/low calorie foods. I'll be walking more. Sleeping well, so as to facilitate weight loss and not make poor decisions.

#### When to eat:

* One meal a day
* 1 hour window to eat
* After work

#### What to eat:

* Get a little bit of every macro, as well as fiber
* Focus on high volume/low calorie foods

#### Others:

* I'll have no junt food at home
* Drink a lot of water
* Walk around the block a few times a day



Low calorie stuff:
* Coke zero
* Strawberries
* Cooked potato
* Broccoli
* ??? Alcohol free beer (somewhat, better off with coke zero)



I explained all about fiber and protein, and how important they both are for helping to regulate appetite. I explained about weighing food. Tracking absolutely everything I eat and drink.
