# Dealing with analysis Paralysis

Your brain makes calculations and your mind warns you of the consequences. You can't find an answer that compels you to action.

The reason for that is that your brain is making intentional misscalculations about the future, which end up paralysing you

Loss aversion


Anytime you think about a decision, you think about two things: the reward and the consequences. These two things are though about by two different areas of the brain.

The area of the brain that thinks about the consequences of a decision is intetionally devorced from reality. The way you beat analysis para paralysis, is by making this part of the brain more commensurate with reality 



The reason you become paralysed is because you don't have enough information to make this calculation. You brain keeps considering the chance of things going wrong.

We need to eliminate or reduce the chance of thigs going wrong, in order to facilitate action.


## Teachings from neuro-economics

### That which you already own is worth more to you than a possibility of something else.**

The longer you own something, the more it is worh it for you

The longer you hold to a pattern, the more you are attached to it.

Exemples:


### The pain of a future loss can be felt today. The pleasure of a future accomplishment cannot

The pain of a loss can be felt on present, even before you ever lose anything.

When your bran makes the calculations about the future, **it cuts the reward by 50% and doubles the loss**. You value losses more than gains.

You experience these inflated pains of losses in the future, and that decreases your motivation to move.

### The order of your thougts matter

Whatever thought you think first is worth more in your decision making than the thougts that come after it.

If you are trying to do something, you need to think fist about the thing that lead you in the direction you want to go.

Example: "I really want to have a drink today, but I shoudn't" vs "I need to take of xyz today, man it'd be nice have a drink"

### Intermixed losses

When you set an end point for something, and within that time frame you can only picture losses, that'll incapacitate you. If you give enought time so that you can see gains mixed between the losses, these individual losses will be much less painful.

The way you frame the end determines how much the loss hurts.

Extend the end point, so as to allow for gains to happen alongside the losses. That will diminish the power of those losses.

Exemple: If

### If you engage in emotional regulation techniques, you diminish the size of the losses on you brain's calculations

Engaging in emotional regulation facilitates making decisions.

You don't necessarily need to spend more time thinking things through, you need instead to calm down your amygdala so it lesses the weigh of losses in the calculations.

The way your brain calculates what goes wrong is not based on reality. 

Stress, fatigue and sleep depravation will amplify the pain of a potention loss, which will make it more difficult for you to act.

People seem to think that once you have things figured out, you'll be carefree, but it works the other way around. You have to be carefree first, and then you easily make decisions.

Decreasing your stress levels with yoga, meditation, detachment and a good night of sleep will facilitate decision making.

### The more Interoceptive you are, the more loss aversion will hurt

The more interoceptive you are, the more you pay attention to your internal environment
