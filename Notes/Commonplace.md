### Thoughts

Life does not need to be any one specific way

No one needs to approve

No one needs to understand

There is nothing worth being upset over

I don't want to wish ill on anyone




Assume the best of other people

Put yourself out there, treat others with respect, wish the best for others

Don't torture yourself with things that you have to do for longer than it would take to do them

---

If I do too many things at the same time, I will not make progress in any of them

Maintenance is always easier than development

If I focus for a few months I can develop a skill. After that, it is easy to maintain, so I can focus on something else.

I want to learn to play the guitar and sing with the remainder of this year.

I want to learn to fall asleep quickly

---

Thoughts are just noise within head. This voice in my head is not who I am, and this is true regardless of if what the voice says is good or bad. I am the one that listen to that voice, not the voice itself.

It is not the job of the mind to figure out how to solve all of your problems. The mind evolved to help you survive in a hunter-gatherer scenario, not to make sense of the modern world, not to try to make everyone like you, not to figure out how to become beautiful, rich, productive and everything else you've been convinced that you need to be.

There is no such thing as "good" or "bad" emotions. Pain is no less worthy of being felt than joy.

Alow yourself to feel your emotions.


### Others

He who has a WHY can bear almost any HOW

Just as the sky remains untouched by passing clouds, you (awareness) remain untouched by passing thoughts.

Remove tension, remove what isn't you

"What’s something useful and enjoyable I can do now?" instead of "What is my true mission in life?"

"Regretting ethical mistakes makes us less likely to repeat them. However, acknowledging their inevitability means that we can let go of ethical anxiety. Ethical maturity is measured by the ability to find good-enough solutions to ethical problems, not by the amount you punish yourself."

My suffering can be ennobling, rather than something to be ashamed of

"It took me almost two decades to figure out even half of this on my own. I was tortured as a child. Tortured by my classmates' constant bullying and my parents' apathy and abuse. Tortured by the relationships and opportunities I missed out on because of fear and trauma. When I went off to college, I isolated myself to prevent that pain from going on any longer. After I graduated, I realized that I had wasted those four years. I've now been in the workforce for over three years. Only this year was I able to actually find happiness by accepting that I had a troubled childhood which made navigating early adulthood a near impossible task. Finally I realized that I shouldn't be leaving my apartment to make friends and have relationships. I should be leaving my apartment because it's what I want to do. That's when I finally felt joy in being around others, rather than the terror I had felt my entire life. Like Sisyphus, I accepted my boulder for what it was. And I felt pride in carrying such a massive boulder up so far."

How much longer will you avoid doing what you are capable of, in order to continue with what you are doing?

You may not wish to move your body, but you will never regret it after the fact



## From books 

### From _The Surrender Experiment_

"If life was unfolding in a certain way, and the only reason I was resisting it was because of a personal preference, I would let go of my preference and let life be in charge."

"Do whatever is put in front of you with all your heart and soul without regard for personal results. Do the work as though it were given to you by the universe itself ─ because it was."

Do whatever you do as a gift to the universe.

The thinking mind is not the same thing as me.

You can listen to your thoughts whithout taking them seriously.

Replace complaining with acceptance.

Life is not an obstacle. It's the field where your skills get tested and honed.

Living will give you opportunities to let go that meditation alone cannot.

### From _The Power of Silence_

"Spiritual awakening is awakening from the dream of thought."

"A maior parte das pessoas confunde o Agora com o que _acontece_ no Agora. Mas não é isso. O Agora é mais profundo do que o que ocorre nele. É o espaço no qual tudo acontece.

Portanto não confunda o conteúdo do momento presente com o Agora. O Agora é mais profundo do que qualquer conteúdo que exista nele."

The present moment doesn't need to be anything other than what it is. It is up to me accept it as it is.
