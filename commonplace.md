### From _The Surrender Experiment_

"If life was unfolding in a certain way, and the only reason I was resisting it was because of a personal preference, I Would let go of my preference and let life be in charge."

"Do whatever is put in front of you with all your heart and soul without regard for personal results. Do the work as though it were given to you by the universe itself ─ because it was."

Do whatever you do as a gift to the universe.

The thinking mind is not the same thing as me.

You can listen to your thoughts whithout taking them seriously.

Replace complaining with acceptance.

Life is not an obstacle. It's the field where your skills get tested and honed.

Living will give you opportunities to let go that meditation alone cannot.

### Thoughts

Life does not need to be any one specific way

No one needs to approve

No one needs to understand

There is nothing worth being upset over

I don’t want to wish ill on anyone
