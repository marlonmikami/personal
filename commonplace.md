### From _The Surrender Experiment_

"If life was unfolding in a certain way, and the only reason I was resisting it was because of a personal preference, I Would let go of my preference and let life be in charge."

"Do whatever is put in front of you with all your heart and soul without regard for personal results. Do the work as though it were given to you by the universe itself ─ because it was."

Do whatever you do as a gift to the universe.

The thinking mind is not the same thing as me.

You can listen to your thoughts whithout taking them seriously.

Replace complaining with acceptance.

Life is not an obstacle. It's the field where your skills get tested and honed.

Living will give you opportunities to let go that meditation alone cannot.



### From _The Power of Silence_

"Spiritual awakening is awakening from the dream of thought."

"A maior parte das pessoas confunde o Agora com o que _acontece_ no Agora. Mas não é isso. O Agora é mais profundo do que o que ocorre nele. É o espaço no qual tudo acontece.

Portanto não confunda o conteúdo do momento presente com o Agora. O Agora é mais profundo do que qualquer conteúdo que exista nele."

The present moment doesn't need to be anything other than what it is. It is up to me accept it as it is.



### Others

Just as the sky remains untouched by passing clouds, you (awareness) remain untouched by passing thoughts.

Remove tension, remove what isn't you



### Thoughts

Life does not need to be any one specific way

No one needs to approve

No one needs to understand

There is nothing worth being upset over

I don't want to wish ill on anyone




Assume the best of other people

Put yourself out there, treat others with respect, wish the best for others
