# 2024

I think I'm ready to make my last attempt

Either get something going by March 21st, 2025, or end my life.

I'm tired of going through cycles of feeling well and then having another depressive periode that lasts for months.

(Should I tell people?)

## The plan to fix things

### Objectives
#### How I want to feel:
* **Awake**, energetic
* **Exited**, having things to look forward to
* **Content**, stop feeling like life is insuficient

#### Skill I want to have:
* Have the skills to get into relationships
* Being able to talk to people in any situation

## The plan in case it doesn't go right.

Pay off my appartment. I have enough money to do that. Give it to my mother, as well as the rest of my money. I should be able to save something like 25~35k to give to her.


Would anyone even want a dead person's possessions?
