# Social Skills

The way to be able to talk to who you want to talk to, is to be able to talk to anyone. The way to be able to talk to anyone, is to talk to everyone.

If you want to talk to someone, talking to other people before it works as warm up.

How many opportunities to talk to people do you have? Take note of all of them.

Stop identifying with introversion. You are as capable to be social as anyone, you simply lack the skills.

## Practical

* Before interacting with someone, visualize a positive outcome, not a negative one. That'll set your mood and vibe correctly.

* Put on a smile before talking to people. You don't need to force it, you need to bring yourself to feel like smiling.
