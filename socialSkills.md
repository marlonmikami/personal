# Social Skills

The way to be able to talk to who you want to talk to, is to be able to talk to anyone. The way to be able to talk to anyone, is to talk to everyone.

If you want to talk to someone, talking to other people before it works as warm up.

How many opportunities to talk to people do you have? Take note of all of them.

Stop identifying with introversion. You are as capable to be social as anyone, you simply lack the skills.

**Intrinsic Motivation > Extrinsic motivation**: Speak because you must. Don't live your entire life censoring yourself.

## You are not different from other people

You don't need confidence in order to talk to other people. That is a failure of perspective.

Your best interactions are those with people you love, and those take no confidence. They happen from a place of comfort.

The more you see others as different from yourself, the bigger the gap you place between the both of you.

What do you have in common with others?

## Practical

* Before interacting with someone, visualize a positive outcome, not a negative one. That'll set your mood and vibe correctly.

* Put on a smile before talking to people. You don't need to force it, you need to bring yourself to feel like smiling.
