# Plan for 2025

Get an international job

## Biggest issue in my life

My mind i a noisy, negative and unpleasant company. I Want to silence it and make it peaceful.

## Focus

1. **This year I will put no effort into finding a relationship, nor will I worry about it**: I started every past year by planning to get a girlfriend. All this worrying got me nothing but anxiety and frustration. Sex and relationships are not and will not be a part of my life, unless I  accidentally stumble on it.
2. **This year I will stop always wearing a friendly mask**: For years I have been working on building a friendly persona, which costs me energy to keep it up and has gotten me nothing. I'll accept my serious countenance.
