# Never Forget

## What dad did to mom

* Left her alone in the hospital, right after having Malcon. Had to walk miles to a bus stop alone while carrying a baby.
* Didn't help her with chores, specially hanging clothes, which made her C-section scar open many times.
* Would disapear for days for “work”, leaving mom alone with Malcon.
* Would not give her money to get medicine.
* Got drunk and kicked her once.
* Cheated on her.
