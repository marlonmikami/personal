# Plan for 2025

1. **This year I will put no effort into finding a relationship, nor will I worry about it**: I started every past year by planning to get a girlfriend. All this worrying got me nothing but anxiety and frustration. Sex and relationships are not and will not be a part of my life, unless I  accidentally stumble on it.
2. **This year I will stop always wearing a friendly mask**: For years I have been working on building a friendly persona, which costs me energy to keep it up and has gotten me nothing. I'll accept my serious countenance.
