# Home Server

It'd be cool to play around with self hosting, using my tiny pc as a home server. Here's some stuff I could do with it:

* Torrenting
* Stream media
* File storage
* Routing? Block ads maybe
* Image gallery


Would be good to learn things such as Docker, Grafana

Look into:

* Radaar - Film downloading
* Sonaar - TV downloading

Ideas:

* "Private sites: No need for a domain name. Your IP and port number will let your friends join you on your undocumented website. Run private forums, blogs, games, etc."
* "Personal sites: Use a home served editor like CKEditor to keep your notes and access them from anywhere. This is also good for secret messaging with your girl. No traceable emails involved."
