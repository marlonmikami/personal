# Social Skills

The way to be able to talk to who you want to talk to, is to be able to talk to anyone. The way to be able to talk to anyone, is to talk to everyone.

If you want to talk to someone, talking to other people before it works as warm up.

How many opportunities to talk to people do you have? Take note of all of them.

Stop identifying with introversion. You are as capable to be social as anyone, you simply lack the skills.

**Intrinsic Motivation > Extrinsic motivation**: Speak because you must. Don't live your entire life censoring yourself.

## You are not different from other people

You don't need confidence in order to talk to other people. That is a failure of perspective.

Your best interactions are those with people you love, and those take no confidence. They happen from a place of comfort.

The more you see others as different from yourself, the bigger the gap you place between the both of you.

What do you have in common with others?

## Practical

* Before interacting with someone, visualize a positive outcome, not a negative one. That'll set your mood and vibe correctly.

* Put on a smile before talking to people. You don't need to force it, you need to bring yourself to feel like smiling.


## Two hit theory

When you go somewhere, you probably got there either alone or with one or two people at a maximum. Over the course of the day/evening/event, people will hope to feel more at home, to leave feeling more comfortable than when they came in.

Instead of thinking of your interactions as these things that need to be impactful and get some sort of result (which only raises the stakes and makes you feel more nervous), try to have very light touch moments with people. Say a little more than perhaps is usual, but don't worry about making conversation or getting anything out of the interaction.

Have as many of these small interactions as you can, with anyone in proximity.

The idea is this: if most people came with one or two friends, then the person who they had that light interaction is now their third best friend in the room. If by the end of that event you are the third best friend for a bunch of people, over the course of that event you are going to be the person that those people will be closing in on.

Make yourself the most approachable person in the room.

The first hit is these little interactions you've done in the beginning of the event. The second hit is the interactions that happen latter as result.
