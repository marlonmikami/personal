# Who am I?
If I do not care about relationships and do not care about having many friends:
## What do I care about?
## What do I do?
* Act professional
## What do I not do?
* I do not watch porn or sexualy stimulating material. How will I not care about relationships if I always have sex on my mind?
* I do not drink alcohol. I'm scared of it. It diminishes the quality of my life, yet I keep going back to it. It makes me sleep worse, it makes me overeat, it makes me gain weight, it keeps me miserable.






Not complaining
