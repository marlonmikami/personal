## Weight Loss

Goal: 60kg

Why: I love beauty and want to have a beautiful body. I want temperance to be an aspect of my life.

My biggest issues:
* Order food too often
* Don't sleep enough


How I'm going to go about doing it:
* Environment:
  * Not having junk food at home
  * Always having fruit at home


Don't go for food when bored
Drink a lot of water (get a big ass water bottle)
Smaller portions
Walking a lot
Counting calories
Volume eating


Low calorie stuff:
* Coke zero
* Strawberries
* Cooked potato
* Broccoli
* ??? Alcohol free beer



I explained all about fiber and protein, and how important they both are for helping to regulate appetite. I explained about weighing food. Tracking absolutely everything I eat and drink.
